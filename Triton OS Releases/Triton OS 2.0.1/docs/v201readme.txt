Triton-series ( TRITON / TRITON pro / TRITON proX )System Version 2.0.1          Aug.17,2000EXB-PCM05 supported:With versions previous to this one, after installing the EXB-PCM05 board the display indicates the wrong board name.  So when installing this card into the Triton-series, please update to this version. This version also fixes some low-level waveform name mis-spellings in the EXB-PCM05 board itself.General[Improvement of function] When the damper is ON, 'all note off' messages (CC#123) are now received properly for the F (MOSS) bank.[Bug fix] In previous versions, after executing "Copy Insert Effect" the indication of FX Category Select was temporarily incorrect. This has been fixed. MIDI[Improvement of function] After dumping a "one program" System Exclusive message, the setting of the program is now updated properly in Combination Mode.[Bug fix] In previous versions if the MIDI Filter "Enable Program Change" (Global P1) was not checked, changing from any of the A - E, G bank programs to the F bank (MOSS) program in order to receive a "one program" System Exclusive dump, resulted in the sound temporarily playing back wrong. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In MOSS Program Mode, when receiving a System Exclusive dump of a program whose OSC type is different from the currently selected one,---e.g. when the selected one is "Standard" and the one being sent is "E.Piano",----the program would not always function correctly. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] Program/Combination mode. In previous versions when receiving the ARP ON/OFF exclusive parameter change, the status of ARP ON/OFF was not reflected immediately. This has been fixed.Sequencer mode[Improvement of function] The Triton plays with RPPR ON from the connected external MIDI device.  After changing "Track Select" while playing patterns and then changing the transmission MIDI channel of the external MIDI device, RPPR functions correctly to the setting, i.e. the function of RPPR has been improved.[Improvement of function] In previous versions when RPPR was ON and many patterns were being played simultaneously with a fast tempo, the "stop" response time of pattern play was not good (using the low C2 or below to stop all patterns playing). This has been improved.[Improvement of function] "End of Pattern" is now indicated at P6 "Event Edit".[Improvement of function] The display updating for the Revert button (P6 RPPR Setup tab) has been improved.  [Improvement of function] In previous versions when loading a "Type 1" Standard MIDI File (Disk Mode, "Load Standard MIDI File") the name of the track where no track event exists used to come up blank. Now it comes up with the initial value of "TRACK 01".[Bug fix] In previous versions the Page 5/6 menu command "Event Edit", "Set Event Filter", would not always filter events properly. This has been fixed.[Bug fix} In previous versions after executing "Load Template Song" (P4 menu command), the indication of Slope in the Zone Map (P4 Velocity or Key Zone) was not updated immediately. This has been fixed.Sampling mode[Improvement of function] The sequencer track events generated by the Time Slice function have been improved.[Improvement of function] In previous versions in cases where the Right and Left samples of a stereo multisample are set to reverse and the data is saved as a new sample, the reverse status was not always saved properly. This has been fixed.[Improvement of function] When a sample waveform is zoomed fully out in the X direction (P1), the quality of the graphic display of Edit Range End has been improved.[Improvement of function] The "Truncate" and "Reverse" commands (P1 and 2 menu commands) have been slightly improved to create better start and endpoint data.[Bug fix] In previous versions when the sound coming from an Audio Input was sent to IFX for sampling, it was always input to the Right side, even though Pan was set to L000. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous versions when a sample file (.KSF file) which shared sample data (waveform data) with another sample in memory was saved into or loaded from external media, the number of the internal sample was indicated incorrectly. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous versions when the graphic display of a sample waveform was zoomed in to the X and Y direction, the waveform was sometimes displayed incorrectly. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous versions after the "Cut" menu command was executed (P1), the setting of the end address was incorrect. This has been fixed.Song Play mode[Bug fix] In previous versions when an SMF song whose tempo was 1/* was played, the display of the location was sometimes incorrect. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous versions when an SMF song whose tempo was */16 was played, it was indicated as */32. This has been fixed.Global mode[Improvement of function] When executing "Change all bank references" at P0 menu command for Combinations, the setting of the Memory Protect Combination parameter (Global mode, P0, System Pref. Tab) is now observed. This means if the Combination memory is protected the command will not execute, so your data remains protected.[Bug fix] In previous versions, when the mode was changed from Sampling to Global directly after powering on, the indication of the drum sample name, etc. of the drum kit (Global, P5) might have been displayed incorrectly. This has been fixed.Disk mode[New function] The value of Transmit Interval Time parameter at Load and Transmit MIDI Exclusive Data dialog has been changed from 00sec ... 30sec to 00.0sec ... 30.0sec.  This enables the user to set up the transmission interval with 0.1 sec units, which is good to do when several exclusive data files are contained within the .EXL file.[Improvement of function] Utility page menu command "Copy".  In cases when copy is executed using the  "*" Wildcard in the file name input dialog, when the correct file does not exist the "File/path not found" error is now indicated.[Improvement of function] When loading AIFF and .WAV files into the Triton, where the data is still not fully supported by the Triton, the new message "File contains unsupported data" is indicated. This can happen in the following instances:a) AIFF or .WAV formats1. Not "Mono" and "Stereo" format data.2. Sample bit resolution is more than 16bit.3. Sampling Freq is more than 48kHz.4. There is no actual PCM data in a file.b) only .WAV1. Not "raw" format PCM data, like ADPCM, etc...c) KSF1. Trinity's compressed format file (TFD-1S through 4S only).[Improvement of function] When several files of KSF, KMP, AIFF, WAVE are loaded, "." is not set up automatically by the system in the file name text input dialog.  This eliminates the possible problems caused by the user not noticing and entering a second period, resulting in illegal file names containing ".".[Improvement of function] The "Load Standard MIDI File" function has been improved to avoid the rare merging of different tracks when loading in Type 1 files.[Bug fix] Utility page menu command "Copy". In previous systems when copying files other than the currently selected one using the file name text input dialog, the copy was not executed correctly if each file was a different size. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous systems when loading Tracks from within an .SNG file (executing Load Tracks), if no event of Track 1 exists in the file, loading could not be executed. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous systems when changing the loaded song at the "Load Pattern Data" dialog, the name of the pattern which is included in the loaded song was not updated properly. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous systems when loading a .KSF file which shares sample data with *.KSF, and a "Memory overflow" error message came up on the screen, the system would not escape from the error even though OK was pressed. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous systems after loading any AKAI program file, the current selection of multi-sample at Sampling mode would be wrong. This has been fixed.[Bug fix] In previous systems just after loading the AIFF file, "Save Sampling Data, All" at Save page menu command would not function correctly. This has been fixed.
